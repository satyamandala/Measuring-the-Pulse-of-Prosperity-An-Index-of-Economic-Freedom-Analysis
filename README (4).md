🔹 Economic Freedom

How easy it is for people and businesses to make economic decisions without too much government control. This includes freedom to own property, trade, invest, work, and start businesses.

🏠 Property Rights

The legal right to own, use, or sell things like land, houses, or businesses. Strong property rights mean no one (including the government) can take your property without a legal reason.

⚖️ Judicial Effectiveness

How well the court system works. If courts are fair, quick, and honest, people trust the legal system. This helps businesses and individuals feel secure.

🧾 Government Integrity

Whether a government is honest or corrupt. High integrity means government officials don’t take bribes, follow laws, and act fairly.

💰 Tax Burden

How much people and businesses have to pay in taxes. It includes:

Income Tax: What individuals pay from their salary.

Corporate Tax: What companies pay on profits.

Tax Burden as % of GDP: How much tax a country collects compared to its total economy.

🏛️ Government Spending

How much money the government spends on things like healthcare, education, defense, etc. High spending is okay if it’s used wisely, but overspending can cause debt.

📉 Fiscal Health

How well a government manages its money. Good fiscal health means it doesn’t borrow too much and can pay its bills.

🏢 Business Freedom

How easy it is to open and run a business. Fewer rules, less paperwork, and faster approvals mean better business freedom.

👷 Labor Freedom

How flexible the job market is. It includes things like:

How easy it is to hire or fire workers

If there are rules about minimum wage or work hours

💵 Monetary Freedom

Whether people can trust the country’s money. It includes:

Stable prices (low inflation)

No unfair price controls (like fixing prices by law)

🌍 Trade Freedom

How easily a country can trade with others. Fewer taxes on imports/exports and fewer restrictions mean more trade freedom.

📈 Investment Freedom

How easy it is for people or businesses to invest their money, either in their own country or abroad. A country with high investment freedom doesn’t have many rules blocking investors.

🏦 Financial Freedom

How open and competitive a country’s banking and finance system is. People can borrow, save, and invest easily, and the government doesn’t control banks too much.

🌐 GDP (Gross Domestic Product)

The total value of all goods and services produced in a country in one year. It’s a basic measure of a country’s economy.

👥 GDP per Capita

GDP divided by the number of people in a country. It shows how much economic value each person creates, on average.

💸 PPP (Purchasing Power Parity)

A way to compare countries by adjusting for the cost of living. For example, $1 buys more in India than in the USA. PPP helps us understand the true value of money in different countries.

📊 Inflation

How much prices go up over time. If inflation is high, your money buys less. Low inflation is a sign of a healthy economy.

📉 Unemployment

The percentage of people who want to work but don’t have a job. Lower unemployment usually means a stronger economy.

🌍 FDI (Foreign Direct Investment)

When businesses or people from one country invest in another country. More FDI often means more jobs and growth.

📉 Public Debt (% of GDP)

How much money the government owes, compared to the size of its economy. Lower debt is usually better, but it depends on how the money is used.

**Charts**

🔹 Top 40 and Bottom Ranking Countries by Economic Freedom (2022)

Top Countries - Have high scores due to strong rule of law, limited government, regulatory efficiency, and open markets.

Bottom Countries - Suffer from political instability, weak institutions, poor fiscal health, and restricted economic activities.

🔹 Index Score Based on Unemployment Rate

Countries like South Africa, Palestine, and Libya show very high unemployment (>30%), contributing to lower economic freedom scores.Low unemployment rates (e.g., in Qatar and Japan) often correspond with higher economic stability.

🔹 Index Score Based on Financial Freedom

Financially restricted countries (e.g., Zimbabwe, Venezuela, North Korea) have very low scores due to state-controlled banking and capital markets.Developed economies with open financial systems (e.g., USA, UK) have higher financial freedom.

🔹 Index Score Based on Population

Most populous countries: China, India, USA, Indonesia.These large populations often require more robust systems for managing economic freedom and governance.

🔹 5-Year GDP Growth Rate Insights

Countries like Ireland, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, and Vietnam have shown strong economic growth over five years.Negative or minimal growth is seen in countries affected by conflict or poor economic management .

🔹 Inflation Rates by Country

Hyperinflation is observed in Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Sudan, with inflation rates in the thousands (%).Stable inflation (under 5%) is seen in many developed economies like Japan, Switzerland, and the USA.

🔹 Correlation Between Inflation and Unemployment

Many countries  exhibit both high inflation and high unemployment, indicating economic distress.Countries like Switzerland and Japan show low values for both, indicating economic stability.

🔹 Correlation Between GDP per Capita (PPP) and Monetary Freedom

Countries with higher GDP per capita  generally have higher monetary freedom, suggesting better-managed inflation and currency policies.Countries with low GDP per capita  tend to have lower monetary freedom.

🔹 Top and Bottom 40 Countries by GDP Growth Rate

Top Performers : Are rapidly developing economies showing high GDP growth (>5%).

Bottom Performers: Have shrinking economies due to war, sanctions, or economic mismanagement.

**STORY**

This dashboard presents a global overview of economic freedom and related indicators for 185 countries in 2022. At a glance, we can see that countries like Singapore, Switzerland, and Ireland rank among the top performers in economic freedom, while nations like Venezuela, North Korea, and Sudan rank at the bottom. As we explore different charts, we notice a strong connection between low unemployment and high economic freedom. For example, countries with low unemployment like Japan and Qatar tend to perform better overall. In contrast, high unemployment is common in lower-ranking countries.

We also see that financial freedom plays an important role. Economies with more open financial systems, like the USA and UK, score higher, while restricted countries like Zimbabwe and Iran score much lower. Population data shows that highly populated countries like India and China face larger economic management challenges. Still, some of them, like India and Vietnam, show strong 5-year GDP growth, highlighting their development efforts.

Another key insight comes from inflation rates. Hyperinflation is a major problem in countries like Venezuela and Zimbabwe, while more stable countries keep inflation under control. The dashboard also shows a correlation between GDP per capita and monetary freedom—wealthier nations often enjoy more stable and open monetary policies. Overall, the dashboard helps us understand how factors like unemployment, inflation, growth, and freedom work together to shape a country's economic performance.
